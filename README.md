---------------------- details --------------------

Changing the DUE's I2C clock rate TWI_CLOCK in 
   arduino-1.5/hardware/arduino/sam/libraries/Wire/Wire.h 
requires restarting the IDE.  TWI speed for teensy 3.0 in Wire.ccp,
must restart IDE.

and TCXOs  with various MCUs 
( UNO, DUE, maple, teensy 3.0,  propeller, beagle, raspberry pi) see
